# CIS 1068 Program Design and Abstraction (Java) Coursework

## About this course

This class is taught at Temple University as an "introduction to problem solving and programming in Java, software engineering, procedural and data abstraction, and object-oriented programming, including class hierarchies, inheritance and interfaces." More information can be found by looking at the [CIS Bulletin](http://bulletin.temple.edu/undergraduate/courses/cis/) and searching for CIS 1068.

The book used is [Think Java Version 6](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-java/) which is [available online for free](http://greenteapress.com/thinkjava6/thinkjava.pdf).

This class was taught using [DrJava](http://www.drjava.org), but I ended up using an online [Cloud9 workspace](https://c9.io/viclou) with shell access instead. (Cloud9 especially came in handy for group projects, where there wasn’t a need to copy/paste code into a shared Google Doc! :wink:)

Additional homework problems were assigned on [Problets](http://problets.org) and [CodingBat Java](http://codingbat.com/java).

I started this class on my 4th week of college. For everything I've done in my first 3 weeks, please refer to my CIS 1051 repo at https://github.com/LabLayers/CIS-1051/blob/master/README.ipynb.

## Content

Below is a direct export from Cloud9 of all the code I’ve written, sorted by week. There were a few assignments where I downloaded the files to edit on my computer, so some files may not represent the complete final version (but I will try my best to update as many as I can.)

Most labs are group projects, and its contributors are credited in Javadoc headers like this:

````java
/**

 * @author Victor Lourng
 * @author Dan Burger
 * @version	2016
 */
````

The Misc Files folders contains random files that don’t belong to any particular folder.
